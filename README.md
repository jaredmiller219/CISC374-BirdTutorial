## Juicy Features

- Snappy Pick-Up – Items squash and stretch when picked up, with a small pop sound and a tiny screen shake.
- Bouncy Drop – Items wobble or bounce when dropped, with a dust puff or ripple effect.
- Cool Inventory Effects – When adding an item, the UI glows, expands, or makes a fun “ding” sound.
- Lively Store Lighting – Lights flicker or dim slightly when big actions happen, and surfaces reflect movement.
- Fun Customer Reactions – NPCs raise eyebrows, mutter, or gasp when you take the last item or drop something.
- Satisfying Checkout – Scanning items makes a beep, a red scanner beam flashes, and a receipt prints smoothly.
